# Single Page Application with Hash Routing

This is a simple Single Page Application (SPA) that uses hash-based routing. The application has multiple pages (Home, About Us, Todos, Contact), and the content of each page is dynamically loaded based on the selected route.

## Features

- **Hash Routing:** The application uses hash fragments in the URL to determine the current route.

- **Dynamic Content:** Each page's content is dynamically loaded based on the route using JavaScript.

- **API Integration:** The Todos page fetches data from an external API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/`) and displays the results.
